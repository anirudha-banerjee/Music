Music
=====

A basic music palyer built for android devices that intelligently chooses songs from the user's database and plays them.
This player uses certain concepts from data mining and machine learning techniques and tries to filter and play songs according to the user's mood.

I am still working on that algorithm. Anyway, what we have here now is just a basic music player for android.
